## Learning Tracker App
I *love* a to do list. This is a simple web app I created to help track and encourage me towards completing my professional development goals. You can use this help you track your learning tasks or customise it for your own needs. You can add, mark as done, and delete tasks. The progress bar updates based on the number of completed tasks.

### Features
- Add new learning tasks to the to-do list.
- Mark tasks as done and see the progress bar update accordingly.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Persistent data storage using the browser's localStorage to retain tasks even after refreshing the page.

### Technologies Used
* HTML: To structure the app.
* CSS: For styling the app and making it responsive.
* JavaScript: To handle the functionality of the to-do list and progress bar.
* localStorage: To persist the data so your tasks are saved between sessions.

### How to Run the App Locally
To run the Learning Tracker app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Download the Project Files
Download or clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Open the Project in Your Browser
You can run this app on your local machine without needing any special server software.
Navigate to the folder containing the files in your file explorer.
Double-click the index.html file. It will open in your default web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
Now, you should be able to interact with the Learning Tracker app and start adding tasks to your to-do list!

3. Test the Functionality

- Mark tasks as done using the "Mark as Done" button.
- Delete tasks using the "Delete" button.
- As you mark tasks as done, the progress bar will update accordingly.


4. Persistent Data (localStorage)
The tasks are saved using localStorage, so they will persist even after refreshing the page. If you open the app again, your tasks will still be there.
